	How we smooth with movable atoms
	These are checked after the above turf based smoothing has been handled
	SMOOTH_ALL or SMOOTH_NONE are treated the same here. Both of those will just ignore atoms
	Using the white/blacklists will override what the turfs concluded, to force or deny smoothing

	Movable atom lists are much more complex, to account for many possibilities
	Each entry in a list, is itself a list consisting of three items:
		Type: The typepath to allow/deny. This will be checked against istype, so all subtypes are included
		Priority: Used when items in two opposite lists conflict. The one with the highest priority wins out.
		Vars: An associative list of variables (varnames in text) and desired values
			Code will look for the desired vars on the target item and only call it a match if all desired values match
			This can be used, for example, to check that objects are dense and anchored
			there are no safety checks on this, it will probably throw runtimes if you make typos

	Common example:
	Don't smooth with dense anchored objects except airlocks
